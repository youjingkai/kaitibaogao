    <br> <img style="width: 40%;margin-left: 45%;transform: translateX(-50%);" src="../imgs/227.jpg" alt=""><br><br><br>
    <br><h4>1.内容概括</h4>
    <br><p>本文的作者是孙亚军，生于八十年代的陕西合阳古莘。他从小便坚信文以载道的古训，崇尚五四一代中国传统学人的风尚，坚持独立的写作方向。而文章便由一个又一个作者童年所经历的故事而组成，详细描绘了偏远乡村的日常生活，表达了作者对于儿时生活的惦念与回忆，映射出作者深刻的人生思索。</p>
    <br><h4>2.主要人物分析</h4>
    <br><ul>
    <br>    <li>玲珍婶子</li>
    <br></ul>
    <br><p>玲珍婶子无疑是一位悲剧性的人物。她是一位社会底层的劳动者，几十年来兢兢业业、辛勤刻苦的培养自己所领养的孩子&mdash;&mdash;不负众望，孩子成功走出乡村，甚至拿到了出国深造的机会。然而，高昂的学费对于农村底层的家庭来说是极其困难的。除此之外，玲珍婶子还有一个从来不管任何事情的男人，十几年来都是她在努力维持家庭的生活，精打细算每一笔开支。玲珍婶子白日里大摆筵席，庆祝自己的女儿学业有成，企图通过不断劳作来麻木自己，而黑夜里却常常暗自神伤，为自己的无能为力而声泪俱下。最终，身患高血压却从不愿意为自己花一分钱的她意外摔倒，从此别离人世，成为了社会阶级以及性别不平等的悲惨产物。</p>
    <br><ul>
    <br>    <li>傻姑</li>
    <br></ul>
    <br><p>傻姑的存在是特别的，她幼年时患过一场重病，而她的父母由于没有文化听从了农村愚医的偏方，以错误的方式治疗傻姑，导致其终身智力低下，成为了所有人的笑柄。从小便遭受他人欺凌的她在冷眼嘲笑中长大，在一次被强奸的情况下意外怀孕&mdash;&mdash;一直胆小懦弱的她居然强硬反抗自己的哥哥，坚持要把孩子生下来。随后，世界上唯一一个爱她的人被气到去世，她又再次成为孤苦伶仃的一人，独自抚养孩子长大。然而，她的儿子不但不对她心怀感激，还责怪且鄙视傻姑，不对自己的母亲给予丝毫关心&mdash;&mdash;最终，傻姑悲惨去世，孤独离开。</p>
    <br><ul>
    <br>    <li>作者母亲</li>
    <br></ul>
    <br><p>母亲是一位知性的女性。她教育作者不要像其他孩子一样嘲笑傻姑，她教会作者如何尊重长者和弱者。同时，她也是传统的，她迷信老猫咀的传说，认为其是一方安静之地，是灵魂黙语的地方，是鬼魂哀嚎的地方。由此，她告诫作者不应轻易的去打扰死者，应给予逝者安静。</p>
    <br><h4>3.作品中性别意识的积极性</h4>
    <br><p>作者对于不同女性形象的塑造是客观的，也是立体化的。她没有一味否认女性的价值，也没有一味打压女性的存在。相反的，她描绘了不同性格不同经历的女性，共同构造出他儿时的生活情景。母亲的存在对作者来说就是正面的，她温婉有礼、知性大方&mdash;&mdash;这种正向女性形象的出现本身便是有进步性的。</p>
    <br><p>除此之外，在作者的叙述过程中，出现了许多例如&ldquo;生育资源&rdquo;&ldquo;包办婚姻&rdquo;等现实性的问题，这表现了作者自身对于社会中现存问题的认识。</p>
    <br><h4>4.作品中性别意识的局限性</h4>
    <br><p>（1）性别刻板印象</p>
    <br><p>尽管作者有注意到塑造&ldquo;正面形象&rdquo;的女性，但这种所谓的积极面仍旧是社会规训的产物。女性的&ldquo;正面&rdquo;体现在其顾家、奉献、贤良淑德之上，而不是多样化和丰富性。由此，这种常量化的性别刻板印象是极其局限的。</p>
    <br><p>（2）对母性的幻想</p>
    <br><p>作品中的三位女性都有一个共通点&mdash;&mdash;泛滥的母性光辉。我并不是要反驳母爱的伟大及母性的无私，但仅仅从作品出发，过于着重强调女性在成为母亲一面的贡献，这便淋漓尽致反映着强烈的俄狄浦斯情结。相反地，对于母爱的强化会遮掩住女性其他方面的闪光点，从而更能达到性别规训下的刻画作用。</p>
    <br><p>具体来讲，作品中一共涉及到了三位母性形象。而第一位玲珍婶子与第二位傻姑实质上是极其相似的，她们都为了自己的孩子愿意奉献一切&mdash;&mdash;平日里她们勤勤恳恳，为了孩子努力奋斗。她们从来不向孩子透露一丝困难，将家庭的重任全部承担在自己身上，为一切劳心劳废。作者这样的描写确实可以深刻体现出母爱的伟大之处，但这种形象背后的缺憾就在于其过于完美&mdash;&mdash;这两位母亲没有任何怨言，她们生活的重心都是为了孩子。比如说傻姑，哪怕和全世界对立，哪怕孩子是由于自己被强暴而意外拥有的，她都始终坚定着自己的无私精神去毅然决然抚养孩子长大&mdash;&mdash;这无疑是作者对于母性完美光辉的过于夸大化和想象。同时，尽管傻姑智力发育如此欠缺，但她心心念念的仍是&ldquo;传宗接代&rdquo;&ldquo;拥有孙子&rdquo;，那么此处作者对傻姑母性的刻画便显示了作者自身传统的性别和家庭观念，同时也映射出社会中传统性别和家庭观念对人的影响之大。除此之外，第三位母性形象则是作者对于其母亲的描述，而在所有的形容中，作者都在着重强调其母亲对礼节的重视、对家庭的重要性，反而抹平了一位知性女性自身的特点，这或多或少也是一种母性想象的体现。</p>
    <br><p>（3）母职惩罚与舆论歧视</p>
    <br><p>在作品中，母职惩罚与舆论歧视体现在各个方面。比如说，傻姑为了抚养孩子放弃了她仅有的哥哥的爱，此外，她还遭受众人嘲讽冷眼，放弃自己所有的时间和经历去抚养孩子。而由于傻姑自身处境的特殊和&ldquo;强奸迷思&rdquo;的趋势，她为了孩子被亲生哥哥使劲殴打，被街坊邻居嘲笑，完全得不到得不到物质上和政策上的任何支持。然而，在作者的叙述中，他并没有对此现象提出抨击，相反的，作者只是自然而然叙述了事情的发展，并默认了这种情况的存在。</p>
    <br><p>（4）结构性不平等的认识缺失</p>
    <br><p>作者在描写傻姑的形象时，最后给予了傻姑足够的同情和期盼，这是十分正面的。然而，作者最后提到&ldquo;希望您来生不要那样傻&rdquo;，那么，傻姑的可怜仅仅只是因为她的&ldquo;傻&rdquo;吗？傻姑的悲惨身世虽然不可否认是基于其智力残缺之上的，但实质上，她的处境也是由于传统社会规训而带来的消极影响。如果傻姑真的拥有正常智力，她的生活真的会有很大程度上的改善吗？这点十分值得读者思考。</p>
    <br><h4>5.总结</h4>
    <br><p>本作品主要目的在于追忆往昔，引发对于生命和岁月的思考。作品沉重的议论中不乏细腻的写作手法，然而可惜的是，其性别方面的优劣点也极其显著。</p>

<h1 class="toph1">Analysis of "Those Far Away Figures”</h1>
<div class="main">
    <br> <img style="width: 40%;margin-left: 45%;transform: translateX(-50%);" src="../imgs/227.jpg" alt=""><br><br><br>

    <br><ol>
    <br>    <li>Content Summary</li>
    <br></ol>
    <br><p>The author of this article is Sun Yajun, born in Guxin, Heyang, Shaanxi Province, in the 1980s. Since childhood, he has believed in the ancient tradition of writing to carry the message. He revered the style of the traditional Chinese scholars of the May Fourth generation and insisted on an independent writing direction. The essay consists of one story after another from the author's childhood, depicting in detail the daily life in a remote village, expressing the author's thoughts and memories of his childhood life, and mapping his profound thoughts on life.</p>
    <br><ol start="2">
    <br>    <li>Analysis of main characters</li>
    <br></ol>
    <br><p>- Aunt Lingzhen</p>
    <br><p>Aunt Lingzhen is undoubtedly a tragic character. She is a laborer at the bottom of society who has been working hard and diligently for decades to raise her adopted child - and, as expected, the child succeeded in getting out of the countryside and even got a chance to study abroad. However, the high tuition fees are extremely difficult for families at the bottom of the countryside. On top of that, Aunt Lingzhen has a man who never cares about anything, and for more than a decade, she's been the one trying to keep the family afloat, meticulously accounting for every expense. Aunt Lingzhen celebrates her daughter's success in school with a feast during the day, attempting to numb herself through constant work while often sinking into tears at night over her powerlessness. Eventually, suffering from high blood pressure but never willing to spend a penny for herself, she accidentally falls and leaves this world, becoming a tragic product of social class and gender inequality.</p>
    <br><p>- Silly aunt</p>
    <br><p>The existence of the silly aunt is exceptional. She suffered a severe illness when she was young, and her uneducated parents listened to the prescriptions of the foolish rural doctors and treated the silly nun in the wrong way, resulting in her lifelong mental retardation and becoming the laughing stock of everyone. After being bullied by others since childhood, she grows up in cold-eyed ridicule and accidentally gets pregnant in a rape situation - she, who has always been timid and cowardly, resists her brother forcefully and insists on giving birth to the baby. Subsequently, the only person in the world who loved her was so angry that he died, and she was once again left alone to raise her child. However, instead of being grateful to her, her son blames and despises the silly aunt and does not show the slightest concern for his mother - who eventually dies tragically and alone.</p>
    <br><p>- The author's mother</p>
    <br><p>The mother is a sensible woman. She teaches the author not to laugh at the silly aunt like other children do, and she leads the author on how to respect the elders and the weak. However, at the same time, she is also traditional. For example, she superstitiously believes in the legend of the old cat's maw, considering it as a quiet place, a place where spirits purr and ghosts wail. Thus, she cautions the author not to disturb the dead easily and to give them silence.</p>
    <br><ol start="3">
    <br>    <li>The positivity of gender consciousness in the work</li>
    <br></ol>
    <br><p>The author's portrayal of different women is objective and three-dimensional. She does not flatly deny the value of women or suppress their existence. On the contrary, she portrays women with different personalities and experiences that together construct the scenes of his childhood life. The mother's presence is positive for the author, and she is gentle, courteous, and generous - the appearance of this positive female figure is progressive in itself.</p>
    <br><p>In addition, many realistic issues such as "reproductive resources" and "arranged marriages" appear in the author's narrative, showing the author's awareness of the existing societal problems.</p>
    <br><ol start="4">
    <br>    <li>Limitations of gender awareness in the work</li>
    <br></ol>
    <br><p>(1) Gender stereotypes</p>
    <br><p>Although the author cares to create a "positive image" of women, this so-called positive side is still the product of social conditioning. The "positivity" of women reflects their care for their families, devotion, and virtue rather than their diversity and richness. Thus, this often quantified gender stereotype is extremely limited.</p>
    <br><p>(2) Fantasy of motherhood</p>
    <br><p>The three women in work all have one thing in common - a flood of maternal glory. I am not trying to refute the greatness of motherly love and the selflessness of motherhood. Still, the overemphasis on the contribution of women in becoming mothers from work alone reflects a potent Oedipus complex. On the contrary, the reinforcement of motherhood can obscure other aspects of women's brilliance and thus better achieve the role of portrayal under gender discipline.</p>
    <br><p>Specifically, there are three maternal figures involved in the work. The first, Aunt Lingzhen, and the second, Silly Aunt, are essentially similar in that they are both willing to give everything for their children - they work hard and strive for their children. They never reveal a single hint of difficulty to their children and take all the family's burden on themselves, toiling away for everything. The author's description deeply reflects the greatness of maternal love, but the flaw behind this image is that it is too perfect - these two mothers do not have any complaints; the focus of their lives is for the sake of their children. For example, the silly aunt, even if she is in opposition to the whole world, even if the child is accidentally possessed due to her rape, she is always determined to raise her child with her selfless spirit - this is undoubtedly the author's over-exaggeration and imagination of the perfect glory of motherhood. At the same time, despite her lack of intellectual development, the silly aunt is still thinking about "passing on her family" and "having grandchildren," so here, the author's portrayal of the giddy aunt's motherhood shows the author's traditional gender and family concepts, and also maps the influence of conventional gender and family concepts on people in society. The author's portrayal of the motherhood of the silly aunt shows the author's conventional gender and family values. It reflects the significant influence of traditional gender and family values on people in society. In addition, the third maternal figure is the author's description of her mother. In all the illustrations, the author emphasizes her mother's emphasis on etiquette and the importance of the family instead of erasing the characteristics of a sensual woman herself, which is more or less a reflection of maternal imagination.</p>
    <br><p>(3) Maternal punishment and public opinion discrimination</p>
    <br><p>In work, maternal punishment and public opinion discrimination are reflected in various aspects. For example, the silly aunt gives up her only brother's love to raise her child, and in addition, she suffers from the ridicule and cold eyes of all the people and gives up all her time and experience to raise her child. Moreover, due to her unique situation and the tendency of "rape myth," she is beaten by her brother and ridiculed by the neighbors for the sake of her child. She is not given any support in terms of materials and policy. However, in the author's narrative, he does not attack this phenomenon; instead, he just naturally describes the development of the situation and consents to its existence.</p>
    <br><p>(4) Lack of awareness of structural inequality</p>
    <br><p>The author's portrayal of the silly nun ends with enough sympathy and expectation, which is very positive. However, the author finally mentions, "I hope you won't be that stupid in the next life" is she pitiful only because of "stupid"? Although her tragic life is undeniably based on her intellectual disability, traditional social rules and regulations also negatively influence her situation. If she had average intelligence, would her life have been improved to a great extent? It is worthwhile for readers to think about this point.</p>
    <br><ol start="5">
    <br>    <li>Summary</li>
    <br></ol>
    <br><p>The primary purpose of this work is to recall the past and provoke thoughts about life and age. The result is heavy with discussion but not lacking in subtlety, but unfortunately, its gender strengths and weaknesses are also very significant.</p>
